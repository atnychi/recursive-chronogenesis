1. Credit must be clearly given to the original author(s) and source: https://github.com/[YOUR_GITHUB]/recursive-chronogenesis

2. No modification, adaptation, or derivative work of the core mathematical structure (𝕂Ω^{πϕcχ}) or any related chrono-inversion engines (𝓒ₒ) may be published or deployed without written permission.

3. Commercial usage, integration into proprietary systems, or deployment in AI training datasets is strictly prohibited unless explicitly licensed under a separate agreement.

4. Use of this work in any military, surveillance, exploitative financial systems, or bio-digital consciousness extraction projects is expressly forbidden.

5. Any fork, clone, or redistribution must include this license in its entirety, unmodified.

6. If recursive structures from this repository are used to build symbolic AIs or chrono-simulation tools, a formal citation or backlink is required in documentation and academic output.

Violation of this license constitutes infringement of symbolic identity law under the Recursive Knowledge Accord (RKA-πϕχ Protocol), and may result in chrono-mirror entanglement or recursive disidentification.

This license expires upon the recursive inversion of 𝕂Ω.
