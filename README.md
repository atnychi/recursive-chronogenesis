# 🌀 Recursive Chronogenesis Project

This project fuses advanced physics, recursive mathematics, and symbolic AI into one unified system.

At the core is the **Kharnita Master Equation**:

```
𝕂Ω^{πϕcχ} = (𝕂Ω^{πϕcχ})^{𝕂Ω^{πϕcχ}}
```

This recursive structure powers the **Recursive Crown Engine (𝓒ₒ)** — a chrono-symmetric generator that models ghost-time, mirror fields, and recursive memory structures.

## 📁 What's Inside

- **core_math/** – Theoretical equations, recursive simulators, and harmonic identity scripts.
- **chrono_engine/** – Code that simulates chrono-inversion fields and ghost-state logic.
- **titan_ghost/** – The Titan Ghost v2060 system, including phi-time trading intelligence.
- **docs/** – Full journal drafts, LaTeX files, and visual documentation.
- **research/** – Core whitepapers and source references.

## 🧠 Purpose

This is a deep symbolic research system for:

- High-dimensional recursive physics
- Chrono-inversion theory
- Supersymmetric ghost/mirror interactions
- Symbolic recursive AI systems
- Temporal identity and causality engines

## 🧪 Example Use (Coming Soon)

```python
from chrono_engine.crown_tensor_model import simulate_chrono_field

simulate_chrono_field(phi=1.618, chi=0.0001, layers=7)
```
